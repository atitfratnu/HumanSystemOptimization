# OptiSystem 9.0: A Powerful Tool for Optical System Design and Simulation
 
OptiSystem 9.0 is a software package that allows users to design, test, and optimize optical communication systems and networks. It offers a comprehensive set of components, models, and visualizers for various applications such as passive optical networks (PONs), 100 Gigabit Ethernet, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), and coherent detection. OptiSystem 9.0 also supports co-simulation with MATLAB and Scilab, as well as a new free space optics (FSO) channel model and a new rare-earth doped fiber model.

In this article, we will review some of the new features and enhancements in OptiSystem 9.0, and show how they can help users to design and simulate complex optical systems and networks.
 
## New Feature: DP-QPSK and QPSK Transmitters
 
OptiSystem 9.0 introduces new transmitter models for dual-polarization quadrature phase shift keying (DP-QPSK) and quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation schemes. These modulation schemes are widely used in high-speed optical communication systems and networks, especially for long-haul transmission and coherent detection. The new transmitter models allow users to easily generate DP-QPSK and QPSK signals with adjustable parameters such as symbol rate, pulse shape, polarization state, phase noise, and frequency offset.
 
## New Feature: Optical Coherent QPSK and DP-QPSK Receiver
 
OptiSystem 9.0 also introduces a new receiver model for optical coherent detection of QPSK and DP-QPSK signals. The receiver model consists of a local oscillator (LO), a polarization beam splitter (PBS), four balanced photodetectors (BPDs), and four digital signal processing (DSP) blocks. The receiver model can perform various functions such as carrier recovery, polarization demultiplexing, phase estimation, symbol decision, and bit error rate (BER) calculation. The receiver model can also handle different impairments such as chromatic dispersion (CD), polarization mode dispersion (PMD), polarization dependent loss (PDL), and nonlinear effects.
 
## New Feature: OFDM Digital Modulators/Demodulators and Line Coders/Decoders
 
OptiSystem 9.0 also adds new models for OFDM digital modulators/demodulators and line coders/decoders. OFDM is a modulation technique that divides the signal bandwidth into multiple subcarriers, each modulated by a different data symbol. OFDM is widely used in wireless communication systems such as Wi-Fi and WiMAX, as well as in optical communication systems such as PONs and 100 Gigabit Ethernet. The new models allow users to easily generate and demodulate OFDM signals with user-defined subcarrier indexes and different types of modulation schemes such as binary phase shift keying (BPSK), QPSK, quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), etc.
 
## New Feature: Burst Modulator and Demodulator Models
 
OptiSystem 9.0 also introduces new models for burst modulator and demodulator. These models are useful for simulating optical burst switching (OBS) networks, which are a type of optical network that transmit data in variable-length bursts rather than fixed-length packets. The burst modulator model can generate bursts with different lengths, data rates, modulation formats, guard bands, etc. The burst demodulator model can detect the burst header, synchronize the burst data, demodulate the burst signal, and recover the original data.
 
## New Feature: MATLAB Component Interface
 
OptiSystem 9.0 also enhances the MATLAB component interface, which allows users to co-simulate OptiSystem with MATLAB in time, frequency, or spatial domain. The MATLAB component interface can be used to implement custom functions or algorithms that are not available in OptiSystem, or to leverage the existing libraries and toolboxes in MATLAB for advanced analysis and visualization. The MATLAB component interface can also exchange data between OptiSystem and MATLAB using various formats such as binary files, text files, or workspace variables.
 
## New Feature: Scilab Component
 
OptiSystem 9.0 also adds a new Scilab component, which allows users to co-simulate Opti
